Data and code for a supporting analysis for the paper

> Bryant J, Rittirong J, Aekplakorn W, Mo-suwan L, Nitnara P, Forthcoming. "A Bayesian approach to combining multiple information sources: Estimating and forecasting childhood obesity in Thailand". *PLOS-ONE*.

The supporting analysis fits a model to WHO data on childhood obesity prevalence. Parameters from the model are used to form an informative prior for annual change in prevalence. For the details, see the paper above. The main analysis is in the repository [bayescomb](https://github.com/johnrbryant/bayescomb).
