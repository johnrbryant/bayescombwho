The supporting analysis fits a model to WHO data on childhood obesity
prevalence. Parameters from the model are used to form an informative
prior for annual change in prevalence. For the details, see the paper
above. The main analysis is in the repository
[bayescomb](https://github.com/johnrbryant/bayescomb).
